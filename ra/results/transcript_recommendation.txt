QUESTION: Based on the team’s shooting %, top scorers, assist distribution and DCI rankings, what coaching or strategy recommendations would you give to the coach?

LLM RESPONSE:
Here’s a set of coaching and strategy recommendations based on the data you’ve provided across shooting %, scoring, assist distribution, and defensive contribution (DCI):
Offensive Strategy
Maximize Playmaking through Emma Ward
With 2.42 assists per game, Ward is the team’s primary facilitator. Structure the attack so she draws defensive pressure, creating space for finishers like Trinkaus and Muchnick.
Consider using her at the top or behind the cage to distribute, rather than always pushing her to take shots (which also reduces her turnover load).
Leverage Efficient Scorers
Muchnick and Trinkaus combine high goals per game (1.7–1.8) with solid shooting percentages, making them dependable finishers.
Design set plays (cutting or inside feeds) that exploit their accuracy, reducing overreliance on Ward’s scoring.
Spread the Scoring Load
Beyond the “big three,” players like Britton, Vogelman, and Cotter average 1+ point per game. Rotate them into scoring schemes more actively so defenses can’t key in on only two or three threats.
Defensive Strategy
Build Around Defensive Specialists
Izzy Lahah and Coco Vandiver stand out with elite ground ball and caused turnover numbers. Use them as match-up defenders against top opposition attackers.
Their presence can allow higher-risk offensive players (Ward, Trinkaus) to stay fresher for transition plays.
Address Negative DCI Players
Key attackers like Ward and Britton show negative DCI largely due to turnovers.
Recommendation: Emphasize decision-making under pressure drills (quick release, safe passing options) to cut down on transition chances given away.
Improve Teamwide Transition Defense
Several attackers (Volpe, Adamson, etc.) show negative or near-zero defensive contributions.
Consider conditioning drills and ride pressure systems so even lower-offense players can add defensive value.
Possession & Efficiency
Reduce Turnovers from Top Scorers
Ward’s 2.16 turnovers per game significantly cut into her otherwise elite production.
Balance her workload with more possessions flowing through Trinkaus and Muchnick, who commit fewer turnovers per play.
Optimize Shot Selection
The overall shooting % (~75% on goal) is good, but not all top scorers convert efficiently.
Track high-percentage shot zones (crease vs outside) and reinforce shot discipline in practice.
Summary Recommendation for the Coach:
Build the offense around Ward’s playmaking but reduce her turnover burden by shifting finishing duties to Trinkaus and Muchnick. Lean on Lahah and Vandiver as defensive anchors while raising baseline defensive contributions from attacking players. Emphasize turnover reduction, transition defense, and role-based shot discipline to balance the team’s strengths in scoring with its weaknesses in defensive consistency.
