QUESTION: Are there any limitations in the dataset that could bias results?

LLM RESPONSE:

Yes — there are several limitations in the dataset that could bias conclusions if not considered:

1. Uneven Games Played (GP)
Some players (e.g., Adamson, Olivia: 3 GP, Volpe, Ashlee: 8 GP) have far fewer games than starters who played all 19.
Comparing totals (goals, assists) across players without normalizing by per-game stats could unfairly undervalue part-time contributors.

2. Small Sample Sizes
Players with very few shots (e.g., Rowley, Payton: 3 shots, Rich, Mackenzie: 1 shot) show extremely high or low shooting percentages, but these are not reliable indicators of skill.
Shot% rankings are biased toward regular shooters with larger sample sizes.

3. Position & Role Bias
Defensive and goalkeeping players (e.g., Guyette, Daniella – GK, Benoit, Kaci – defender) naturally contribute fewer goals/assists.
Without accounting for position, conclusions may incorrectly label them as underperformers.

4. Missing/Zero Data
Some rows are incomplete or contain all zeroes (e.g., Nash, Alice; Peers, Ava; Hanlon, Allie).
This may reflect missing data or inactive players, which could skew team averages if included.

5. Aggregated Team Totals
The "Total" row summarizes team performance, but does not capture distribution of contributions (e.g., reliance on top scorers like Muchnick, Trinkaus, Ward).
Without context, one might overestimate balance in scoring/assists.

6. Context Not Captured
No information on minutes played, opposition strength, or game situations (e.g., power plays, clutch scoring).
Players with fewer minutes but high efficiency could be overlooked.

In summary: The dataset’s main biases come from uneven participation (GP), small sample sizes inflating efficiency stats, position-based role differences, and lack of contextual variables. Any conclusions should normalize stats (per game, per shot) and consider roles to avoid misleading interpretations.
Do you want me to create a bias-aware version of the top scorers/assist leaders, where I re-rank them using per-game metrics only?
