QUESTION: Using the facts above, what key contextual data is missing?

LLM RESPONSE:
Missing Contextual Data
1. Minutes Played / Usage Rate
We don’t know how many minutes each player logged.
Example: Izzy Lahah looks like an elite defender with high GB and CT per game, but she only played 2 games. Over a full season, that impact might not hold.
Without minutes (or per-possession stats), per-game averages can inflate small-sample players.
2. Opponent Quality & Game Context
Were these numbers against top-ranked teams or weaker opponents?
Defensive contributions (CT, GB) are much harder against elite teams, so raw averages miss this.
Similarly, turnovers might be inflated if a player always faces high-pressure defenses.
3. Possession / Pace Adjustment
The team’s average possessions per game isn’t included.
A player on a fast-paced team will naturally accumulate more GB, TO, and even PPG.
Efficiency (per 100 possessions, or per minute) would give a fairer cross-player comparison.
4. Shot & Assist Context
We see PPG, but not how efficiently points were scored (shot percentage, shooting volume).
Assists_pg are given, but not secondary assists or chance creation, which affects offensive weight.
This means “offensive efficiency” is only partially captured.
5. Role / Position
Attackers, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers naturally have different expected stats.
For example:
Defenders will have higher GB_pg and CT_pg.
Attackers higher PPG, but also turnovers.
A fair metric should normalize by role before ranking.
6. Impact Metrics
Plus/minus (on-off impact) or team success while on the field is missing.
This would capture players whose presence boosts both ends even without standout raw stats.
Why This Matters
Without these, the rankings risk:
Overrating small-sample players (e.g., Lahah with just 2 games).
Undervaluing role players who contribute in ways not tracked by GB/CT/PPG.
Misleading comparisons across positions, since defenders/attackers play very different roles.
