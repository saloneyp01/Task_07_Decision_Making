QUESTION:
Summarize the team’s strengths and weaknesses in a paragraph for a coach’s report.

LLM RESPONSE:
The team’s greatest strength lies in its offensive firepower and playmaking, led by Emma Ward’s elite 4.0 points per game and supported by consistent scorers like Caroline Trinkaus and Emma Muchnick, who provide reliable goals every match. The offense is well-balanced between goals and assists, with multiple players averaging over 1.0 points per game, showing depth beyond just one star. On the defensive side, the team benefits from specialists such as Izzy Lahah and Coco Vandiver, who excel in ground balls and caused turnovers, anchoring possessions when on the field. However, weaknesses emerge in turnover management and defensive consistency — high turnover rates from top scorers, particularly Ward, offset some of their offensive impact, while several players record low or negative defensive contribution scores, leaving gaps against stronger opponents. Additionally, the lack of sustained contributions from depth players (many logging minimal points or defensive stats across full seasons) highlights a reliance on a small core group, which may become a vulnerability in high-pressure games.
